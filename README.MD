# TailPress
A minimal boilerplate theme for WordPress using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) and [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/).

## Getting started
* Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/pixeldevsio/tailpress.git && cd tailpress`
* Run `rm -rf .git` to remove git.
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run development`
* Run `npm run watch` to start developing

You will find the editable CSS and Javascript files within the `/resources` folder.

Before you use your theme in production, make sure you run `npm run production`.

## Block editor support
TailPress comes with basic support for the [block editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/).

CSS-classes for alignment, background and text colors will be generated automatically. You can modify this within the `tailwind.config.js` file.

To make the editing experience within the block editor more in line with the front end styling, a `editor-style.css` is generated. This file is only compiled on production builds.

### Define theme colors
Four colors (primary, secondary, dark and light) are defined from the beginning. You can modify the colors in `tailpress.json`.

### Define theme font sizes
You can modify the font sizes within `tailpress.json`.

## JIT
[Tailwind CSS JIT](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-jit) is used to allow for fast compiling.

If you prefer to use the regular Tailwind CSS instead, you can change to that dependency in `package.json` as was done up to TailPress v0.0.7 ([example](https://github.com/jeffreyvr/tailpress/blob/0.0.7/package.json#L33)).
Also make sure to you change the PostCSS plugins in `webpack.mix.js` ([example](https://github.com/jeffreyvr/tailpress/blob/0.0.7/webpack.mix.js#L16)).

## PurgeCSS
By default, PurgeCSS is enabled. You can modify or disable it by changing the settings in the `tailwind.config.js` file. There are several [PurgeCSS options](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#purge-css-options).
